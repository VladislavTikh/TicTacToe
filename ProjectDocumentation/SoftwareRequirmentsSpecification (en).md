 ### 1. Introduction <a name="1"></a>
There are plenty of mobile and desktop tictactoe applications that allow you to play with bots or human opponent. Regular tictactoe game is quite simple and doesn't require you to think about your moves a lot, all possilbe moves have already been calculated and game is in "Draw death" position right now. If both players play perfect game it 
inevitably ends up in draw.There is an upgrade of this well-known game that's called Ultimate(super) tic-tac-toe that requires much more attention and effort to win the game. It's hard to precalculate the outcome of the game and that brings new interest in gameplay.This gamemode poorly developed and existing applications don't provide appropriate comfort level. Web applications are full of advertising and have poor user experience. Ultimate TicTacToe is the application with conventient interface and simple logic.

### 4. Game Description <a name="4"></a>
#### 4.1 Game Goals <a name="4.1"></a>
The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an m√ón board, with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row.
##### 4.2 Game Rules <a name="4.2"></a>
Each small 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board is referred to as a local board, and the larger 3-by-3 board is referred to as the global board.
The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots. This move 'sends' their opponent to its relative location. For example, if X played in the top right square of their local board, then O needs to play next in the local board at the top right of the global board. O can then play in any one of the nine available spots in that local board, each move sending X to a different local board.
If a move is played so that it is to win a local board by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then the entire local board is marked as a victory for the player in the global board.
Once a local board is won by a player or it is filled completely, no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to such a board, then that player may play in any other board.
Game play ends when either a player wins the global board or there are no legal moves remaining, in which case the game is a draw.
